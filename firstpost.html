                    <p>The comment tag is created by the use of the <!> . Comments enable the author of an HTML document to add text to a browser that is not directly visible. It is advised to add comments to your code because it can explain the meaning of something that may be forgotten later on. These HTML comments can only be viewed in the source code of the website. Throughout my website, I will be doing a comprehensive study on the role of commenting within the source code of an HTML document.</p>

                    <p>First of all, we must understand what a comment is. A comment is a spoken or written statement that expresses an opinion about someone or something. The second definition is that a comment is a written note that explains or discusses the meaning of something (such as a piece of writing). The last definition is that a comment is spoken or written discussion about something (such as an event in the news).</p>

                    <p>Then what needs to be understood is the role of a comment. We can understand that a comment is the expression of opinion and that it can explain meaning or open up dialogue between a groups of people. I believe that a comment, when boiled down to the bare essentials is that it was a small, written act that conveys the speaker’s intent. </p>

                    <p>To begin, we need to connect past technologies with new technologies. The  development of "protocols, procedures, programs and concepts" is important to understand, especially as we dig deep into trying understand how the simple element <code> <!> </code> originated in the documentation of HTML. In the creation of any useful tool, proper instructions must be given. In this way anyone may be able to quickly adopt it. </p>

                    <p>The website, “Request For Comments", gives us a snapshot or a glimpse on how the programmers across the US created this process. The programmers, who were all part of the IETF, or the (Internet Engineering Task Force) initially communicated through physical mail.</p>

                    <p>These programmers quickly pivoted and created technologies to communicate on the internet. This would mark the origin point of source code commenting as well the initial concepts to email.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p> -->
