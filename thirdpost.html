                    <p>Source code comments are comments found in a program, written by the programmer which does not directly affect the program. They are static creations that stand the test of time. However, despite their static nature, the approach to writing source code comments has begun to change. In "Do Code and Comments Co-Evolve?", we are given a glimpse on how open source systems are beginning to change.</p>

                    <p>One result that really does strike an interesting point is that "newly added code barely gets commented". While the original author may have the authorial gravitas to enact changes, the open source contributors pivot in an entirely other direction. Source code and the comments within the same program do not seem to evolve. However, source code as a whole does share some intimate relationships with comments.</p>

                    <p>In another study, it's clearly stated that, "It is common, especially in large software systems, for developers to change code without updating its associated comments due to their unfamiliarity with the code or due to time constraints."</p>

                    <p>Simply put, developers often lack the authorial intent to feel the need or the ability to place comments on source code. It can experience fluctuation based on an a abnormally active developer, but it really does remain static.</p>

                    <!-- <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

                    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p> -->

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
